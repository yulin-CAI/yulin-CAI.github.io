I am a Mathematics postdoc in the group of Walter Gubler and Klaus KÃ¼nnemann at Regensburg University, Germany. I got my PhD at University of Bordeaux, France, under the supervision of Yuri Bilu and Qing Liu.

## Research interests:

I am interested in number theory and related subjects. Right now, I am working on non-archimedean geometry and Arakelov theory. 
I am passionate about calculating integral solutions and rational solutions of Diophantine equations, and its connections with other subjects.
